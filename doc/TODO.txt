This is a list of ideas and TODO-Items for live plugin.

- Add better support for the numerous CSS bugs in IE. Maybe by
  splitting style files in a similar way like it is done for YAML
  (http://www.yaml.de)

- Create a CSS-themeing friendly URL scheme. I.E. something like
  img/<theme>/button.png. Where default as theme is always taken if
  <theme> is not found.
- Give users the chance to override the selected style with some
  user-override settings.
- Deliver truly static content, like images, styles, ECMAscript
  with Tntnet's send-file functionality after resolving user selected
  themes paths. Take care to support browser cache optimization.

- Deliver EPG box information through AJAX. This would make a ECMAScript
  capable browser mandatory.
- Provide a way to get the information on extra 'static' pages.
