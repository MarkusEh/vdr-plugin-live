This is a list of ideas and TODO-Items for Live plugin.

- Add better support for the numerous CSS bugs in IE. Maybe by
  splitting style files in a similar way like it is done for YAML
  (http://www.yaml.de)

  -> VOID, as IE is out of service and modern browsers do not
     show such misbehavior.

- Create a CSS-themeing friendly URL scheme, i.e., something like
  img/<theme>/button.png. Where default theme is always taken if
  <theme> is not found.

  -> UNNECESSARY, as themes are configured through the setup form.
     URLs not referring a defined scheme should validly fail.

- Give users the chance to override the selected style with some
  user-override settings.

  -> DONE, as 'siteprefs.css' are are available.

- Deliver truly static content, like images, styles, ECMAscript
  with Tntnet's send-file functionality after resolving user selected
  themes paths. Take care to support browser cache optimization.

- Deliver EPG box information through AJAX. This would make a ECMAScript
  capable browser mandatory.

  -> DONE, as the EPG box periodically polls the server to update
     the current show.

- Provide a way to get the information on extra 'static' pages.
