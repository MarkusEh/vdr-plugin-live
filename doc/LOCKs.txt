Concept:

A method returning a VDR object like cRecording requires the corresponding
VDR global table (cRecordings) as input parameter.

Reasoning:
cRecordings (LOCK_RECORDINGS_READ) must be locked anyhow, otherwise it is
not allowed to use the returned cRecording.
So, requesting this parameter reduces the chance that the developer will
forget this rule ...
