	* new user management within setup that also handles different
	  user rights

2008-11-19  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
	* new setup option to display channels without EPG
	
2008-10-21  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
	* edit_timer.ecpp: new menu entry to select a recording directory.
	  requires epgsearch plugin.
	* epgsearch.h/cpp: read the directory list via epgsearch's
	  service interface version 1.2
	
2008-08-04  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
	
	* italian translation update, thanks to Diego Pierotto
	
2008-02-07  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

	* new menu with timer conflicts
	
2008-02-07  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* buildutil/version-util: Further posix-ified the script.

2008-02-06  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* buildutil/version-util: Function definitions in shell should not
	  have whitespaces between the name and the parentheses.
	* i18n-generated.h: updated with latest translation contributions.

2008-01-25  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* recman.cpp: Fixed memory leak, which resulted through the use of
	  circular references by using tr1::shared_ptr, where a
	  tr1::weak_ptr would have been needed.

	* pages/recordings.ecpp: Added button to delete that single
	  recording. This feature is somehow limited in usability and
	  should be used only for occasional deletion of recordings,
	  because the page reloads when a recording is
	  deleted. Unfortunately there is currently no way to remember the
	  position to where the user navigated before he hit the delete
	  button. In order to delete an other recording in the same
	  subdirectory he will need to navigate there again after the page
	  reloaded.

2008-01-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* buildutil/version-util*: Added a shell and an awk script to
	  calculate a version suffix string out of CVS current working dir
	  status. This was a request bei jo01 and helps distinguish if
	  newer versions are awailable. It should not break builds if
	  something goes wrong in the script. At least it was my
	  intention.  The script also supports git repositories. But it
	  has not been tested if it determines the correct git commit id
	  based on current workdir contents.  The caluculated version
	  suffix is appended to the LIVE version string visible in the
	  about box (?-Menu entry).

2008-01-15  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
	* whats_on.ecpp: added listing 'Favorites', that lists all search
	  results of search timers with setting 'Use in favorites menu'
	* Makefile: reversed Makefile changes that avoided commit conflicts,
	  but caused compile time problems
	* po/*.po: added "translation team" since msgfmt complains about that

2008-01-04  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* Makefile: Thanks to user 'ernie' in vdr-portal.de, who pointed
	  out that the Makefile uses a bashism without setting SHELL to
	  bash.
	  UPDATE: User 'Keef' pointed out a way to omit bash arithmetic
	  expressions. So the dependency on bash could be dropped again.

2007-12-25  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Added configuration option to disable the creation of IMDb URLs
	  in the epg-info sections. This was done upon of feature
	  reqest (Bug #401).
	  Some minor fixes for the IMDb URLs in recordings.

2007-12-23  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* po/*.po
	  Modified headers in the .po files and updated copyright
	  information to be more LIVE plugin aware.
        * Makefile
	  Changed top level Makefile to not create headers in live.pot
	  file. This prevents creation of new date header in .po file at
	  fresh translations after updates from CVS and should avoid
	  continous conflicts at every cvs update even if no changes took
	  place in the local files.

2007-12-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* live/js/live/vlc.js
	  Added an own mootools based implementation of a controlling
	  class for the vlc plugin as proposed by Rolf Ahrenberg.
	  Features currently supported are:
	    - start/stop play (pause is left out because it provides no
	      timeshift functionality).
	    - mute sound. (Use this instead of pause)
	    - switch to full screen mode.
	    - close the popup window.
	  The class is customizable and you can see in vlc.ecpp how
	  customization for the changed button strings has been done.

2007-12-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Integrated a new patch Rolf Ahrenberg sent to me privately
	  The patch updates finish translations.
	  Autoplay and the 'standard' video size is used in the playback
	  window.

2007-12-17  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Adapted Rolf Ahrenbergs patch for VLC plugin streaming to the
	  browser window using streamdev-server plugin on VDR.  See
	  Bug-Entry #343.  You can stream current running program from the
	  "whats_on now" schedules page into an extra browser window if
	  javascript is active.  Otherwise you get redirected onto a
	  dedicated new live streaming page.

2007-10-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Renamed recordings.h/cpp files to recman.h/cpp. Adapted
	  files that included them.
	- recman.h has extended functionality for recordings. It is not used
	  yet.

2007-10-17  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* css/styles.css
	* live/themes/orange-blue/css/theme.css
	  Fix missing background color settings for browsers that don't
	  have white as default background. Thanks to zirias.
	  See: http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?postid=659497#post659497

2007-09-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Eliminated 'images' directory. The images are now not longer
	  compiled with ecpp into the executable module of live. With the
	  content.ecpp part and file cache we have a equally performant
	  solution to compiled in files.
	- Added file cache preload functionality. The file cache is filled
	  with a list of files defined at compile time on plugin startup
	  time.

2007-09-09  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* tntconfig.cpp: allways give absolute paths to content.ecpp
	* pages/content.ecpp: check for absolute paths which don't contain
		upward references (e.g. '../') and deny such requests.

2007-09-07  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* tntconfig.cpp: Checked and adapted MapUrl regular expressions
	                 to be more live setup secure.

2007-08-19  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Adapted (but not tested) live for the new localisation scheme
	  since VDR 1.5.7
	  Might need some additional tweaking...

2007-07-29  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	- Implemented status notification popup if ajax is active.
	- Without Ajax it is now possible to request actions from vdr via
	  a static page.

2007-07-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Added toolbox buttons to epg info popup windows.
	Some style fixes for this.
	* pages/whats_on.ecpp: Use new pageelems.epg_tool_box component.
	* pages/pageelems.ecpp: new epg_tool_box component.

2007-07-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* live/js/live/pageenhance.js: Enhance a normal web page with
		nifty web 2.0 features.
	* live/js/live/infowin.js: stand alone class. Used by pageenhance.js
	* live/js/live/hinttips.js: stand alone class. Used by pageenhance.js

2007-07-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Made epgimages better styleable. Displaying them as floats right
	of the epg description text.

2007-07-20  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

	Added support for EPG images: Specify the directory with your
	EPG images via the new commandline option '-e <dir>' or
	'--epgimages=<dir> like
	-P'live -e /video/epgimages'

2007-07-12  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Changed the javascript base of live. We now use the 'mootools'
	framework (see http://www.mootools.net for infos) to handle
	javascript in a browser independend fashion and for nifty Web 2.0
	features.

	Based on this framework we have now tooltips that use the XHTML
	standard 'title' attribute and Web-2.0 popup windows for epg
	information. This Epg information is loaded on demand and once
	loaded, they are cached in the page for further viewing.

	On the other hand this also provides us with a solution to have
	live functioning without javascript at all. When done right, the
	same functionality can be achieved with or without enabled
	javascript in the browser. Currently there still are javascript
	only features, which will be resolved in the next weeks.

	This is a rather big change on many files, so they are not all
	mentioned here.

2007-06-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Start of new 'standalone' javascript source directory
	for live javascript files.

	- Use mootools http://www.mootools.net/ as base library for
	  'modern' Javascript based functionality.

2007-06-15  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* setup.ecpp: added option to disable infobox at all.

2007-06-14  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* infobox: Keep update status of infobox in session. This allows
	  the user to switch off status updates and change live
	  pages. After a page change the status is updated once and then
	  the users choice is respected.

2007-06-14  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* infobox: show 'user friendly' error message when something went
	  wrong while updating the status box.
	  Fixed tooltip message for toggle update on/off of status box.

2007-06-13  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	* pages/schedule.ecpp: If no channel is given, and a current
	  channel is known to vdr, select it when calling the schedule
	  page in live.

2007-06-12  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Added orange-blue theme as an example of a theme with dark
	background and light foreground colors. This theme also
	demonstrates the use of exchanged images (logo.png, tv.jpg and
	remotecontrol.jpg)

	* styles.css: some minor style fixes, that became visible while
	creating the orange-blue theme.

2007-06-11  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Fixed style layout of the tables. Added class 'bottomrow' to the
	rows that are followed by empty spacer rows.

2007-06-06  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Use GetConfigDir instead of USRDIR define.

	* pages/*.ecpp: begin of unification of table markup.
		Still needs some tweaking but the general framework
		is in place.
	* styles.css: Removed different table styles.
		Added two general table styles:
		 - listing: for tables showing listings like
			    search results or schedules.
		 - formular: for tables used in input forms to
			     layout the input elements.
		Added some general use styles, like 'bold', 'more',
		'withmargin', 'nomargin', 'short', 'title', 'dotted'

2007-06-03  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	Added CSS based themeing support. For details please read
	doc/css-themeing.txt and doc/dev-conventions.txt.
	* setup.h, setup.cpp, setup.ecpp: added setup for theme and
		selection of theme.
	* pages/*.ecpp: added support for themable images.
	* tntconfig.cpp: cascaded search for images, to support themeing.

2007-06-03  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

	Setup includes now a local net mask specifying the address range
	without necessary login (#321)

2007-06-02  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

	required version of VDR is now >= 1.4.0-2

2007-06-01  Sascha Volkenandt <sascha at akv-soft dot de>

	The detection of featured plugins was uniformed. The display in
	the about box now reads "active: <version>" or "required:
	<version>"

2007-06-01  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

	These changes fix bug entry #339
	* css-themeing.txt: describe how to do css themeing.
	* content.ecpp:
		- check for additional parameter and use it as mime
		  type.
		- use compile time variable USRDIR for path to the files
		  loaded via content.ecpp
	* pageelems.ecpp: link to css/siteprefs.css
	* pages/*.ecpp: changed style link to pageelems.stylesheet
		        component.
	* tntconfig.cpp: added MapUrl for css<something>/cssfile.

unrecorded  Sascha Volkenandt <sascha at akv-soft dot de>

	Due to the introduction of a uniform header for C++ standard
	extenstions, the boost library is now only necessary if the used
	g++ compiler version is less than 4.0
