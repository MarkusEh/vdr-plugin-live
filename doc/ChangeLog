2009-09-07  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
..* new user management within setup that also handles different
..  user rights

2008-11-19  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
..* new setup option to display channels without EPG
..
2008-10-21  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
..* edit_timer.ecpp: new menu entry to select a recording directory.
..  requires epgsearch plugin.
..* epgsearch.h/cpp: read the directory list via epgsearch's
..  service interface version 1.2
..
2008-08-04  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
..
..* italian translation update, thanks to Diego Pierotto
..
2008-02-07  Christian Wieninger  <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

..* new menu with timer conflicts
..
2008-02-07  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* buildutil/version-util: Further posix-ified the script.

2008-02-06  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* buildutil/version-util: Function definitions in shell should not
..  have whitespaces between the name and the parentheses.
..* i18n-generated.h: updated with latest translation contributions.

2008-01-25  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* recman.cpp: Fixed memory leak, which resulted through the use of
..  circular references by using tr1::shared_ptr, where a
..  tr1::weak_ptr would have been needed.

..* pages/recordings.ecpp: Added button to delete that single
..  recording. This feature is somehow limited in usability and
..  should be used only for occasional deletion of recordings,
..  because the page reloads when a recording is
..  deleted. Unfortunately there is currently no way to remember the
..  position to where the user navigated before he hit the delete
..  button. In order to delete an other recording in the same
..  subdirectory he will need to navigate there again after the page
..  reloaded.

2008-01-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* buildutil/version-util*: Added a shell and an awk script to
..  calculate a version suffix string out of CVS current working dir
..  status. This was a request bei jo01 and helps distinguish if
..  newer versions are available. It should not break builds if
..  something goes wrong in the script. At least it was my
..  intention.  The script also supports git repositories. But it
..  has not been tested if it determines the correct git commit id
..  based on current workdir contents.  The calculated version
..  suffix is appended to the LIVE version string visible in the
..  about box (?-Menu entry).

2008-01-15  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>
..* whats_on.ecpp: added listing 'Favorites', that lists all search
..  results of search timers with setting 'Use in favorites menu'
..* Makefile: reversed Makefile changes that avoided commit conflicts,
..  but caused compile time problems
..* po/*.po: added "translation team" since msgfmt complains about that

2008-01-04  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* Makefile: Thanks to user 'ernie' in vdr-portal.de, who pointed
..  out that the Makefile uses a bashism without setting SHELL to
..  bash.
..  UPDATE: User 'Keef' pointed out a way to omit bash arithmetic
..  expressions. So the dependency on bash could be dropped again.

2007-12-25  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Added configuration option to disable the creation of IMDb URLs
..  in the epg-info sections. This was done upon of feature
..  request (Bug #401).
..  Some minor fixes for the IMDb URLs in recordings.

2007-12-23  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* po/*.po
..  Modified headers in the .po files and updated copyright
..  information to be more LIVE plugin aware.
        * Makefile
..  Changed top level Makefile to not create headers in live.pot
..  file. This prevents creation of new date header in .po file at
..  fresh translations after updates from CVS and should avoid
..  continuous conflicts at every CVS update even if no changes took
..  place in the local files.

2007-12-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* live/js/live/vlc.js
..  Added an own mootools based implementation of a controlling
..  class for the VLC plugin as proposed by Rolf Ahrenberg.
..  Features currently supported are:
..    - start/stop play (pause is left out because it provides no
..      timeshift functionality).
..    - mute sound. (Use this instead of pause)
..    - switch to full screen mode.
..    - close the popup window.
..  The class is customizable and you can see in vlc.ecpp how
..  customization for the changed button strings has been done.

2007-12-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Integrated a new patch Rolf Ahrenberg sent to me privately
..  The patch updates finish translations.
..  Autoplay and the 'standard' video size is used in the playback
..  window.

2007-12-17  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Adapted Rolf Ahrenbergs patch for VLC plugin streaming to the
..  browser window using streamdev-server plugin on VDR.  See
..  Bug-Entry #343.  You can stream current running program from the
..  "whats_on now" schedules page into an extra browser window if
..  javascript is active.  Otherwise you get redirected onto a
..  dedicated new live streaming page.

2007-10-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Renamed recordings.h/cpp files to recman.h/cpp. Adapted
..  files that included them.
..- recman.h has extended functionality for recordings. It is not used
..  yet.

2007-10-17  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* css/styles.css
..* live/themes/orange-blue/css/theme.css
..  Fix missing background color settings for browsers that don't
..  have white as default background. Thanks to zirias.
..  See: http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?postid=659497#post659497

2007-09-18  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Eliminated 'images' directory. The images are now not longer
..  compiled with ecpp into the executable module of live. With the
..  content.ecpp part and file cache we have a equally performant
..  solution to compiled in files.
..- Added file cache preload functionality. The file cache is filled
..  with a list of files defined at compile time on plugin startup
..  time.

2007-09-09  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* tntconfig.cpp: allways give absolute paths to content.ecpp
..* pages/content.ecpp: check for absolute paths which don't contain
..	upward references (e.g. '../') and deny such requests.

2007-09-07  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* tntconfig.cpp: Checked and adapted MapUrl regular expressions
..                 to be more live setup secure.

2007-08-19  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Adapted (but not tested) live for the new localization scheme
..  since VDR 1.5.7
..  Might need some additional tweaking...

2007-07-29  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..- Implemented status notification popup if AJAX is active.
..- Without Ajax it is now possible to request actions from VDR via
..  a static page.

2007-07-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Added toolbox buttons to EPG info popup windows.
..Some style fixes for this.
..* pages/whats_on.ecpp: Use new pageelems.epg_tool_box component.
..* pages/pageelems.ecpp: new epg_tool_box component.

2007-07-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* live/js/live/pageenhance.js: Enhance a normal web page with
..	nifty web 2.0 features.
..* live/js/live/infowin.js: standalone class. Used by pageenhance.js
..* live/js/live/hinttips.js: standalone class. Used by pageenhance.js

2007-07-21  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Made EPG images better style-able. Displaying them as floats right
..of the EPG description text.

2007-07-20  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

..Added support for EPG images: Specify the directory with your
..EPG images via the new command-line option '-e <dir>' or
..'--epgimages=<dir> like
..-P'live -e /video/epgimages'

2007-07-12  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Changed the javascript base of live. We now use the 'mootools'
..framework (see http://www.mootools.net for infos) to handle
..javascript in a browser independent fashion and for nifty Web 2.0
..features.

..Based on this framework we have now tooltips that use the XHTML
..standard 'title' attribute and Web-2.0 popup windows for EPG
..information. This EPG information is loaded on demand and once
..loaded, they are cached in the page for further viewing.

..On the other hand this also provides us with a solution to have
..live functioning without javascript at all. When done right, the
..same functionality can be achieved with or without enabled
..javascript in the browser. Currently there still are javascript
..only features, which will be resolved in the next weeks.

..This is a rather big change on many files, so they are not all
..mentioned here.

2007-06-22  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Start of new 'standalone' javascript source directory
..for live javascript files.

..- Use mootools http://www.mootools.net/ as base library for
..  'modern' Javascript based functionality.

2007-06-15  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* setup.ecpp: added option to disable infobox at all.

2007-06-14  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* infobox: Keep update status of infobox in session. This allows
..  the user to switch off status updates and change live
..  pages. After a page change the status is updated once and then
..  the users choice is respected.

2007-06-14  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* infobox: show 'user friendly' error message when something went
..  wrong while updating the status box.
..  Fixed tooltip message for toggle update on/off of status box.

2007-06-13  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..* pages/schedule.ecpp: If no channel is given, and a current
..  channel is known to VDR, select it when calling the schedule
..  page in live.

2007-06-12  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Added orange-blue theme as an example of a theme with dark
..background and light foreground colors. This theme also
..demonstrates the use of exchanged images (logo.png, tv.jpg and
..remotecontrol.jpg)

..* styles.css: some minor style fixes, that became visible while
..creating the orange-blue theme.

2007-06-11  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Fixed style layout of the tables. Added class 'bottomrow' to the
..rows that are followed by empty spacer rows.

2007-06-06  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Use GetConfigDir instead of USRDIR define.

..* pages/*.ecpp: begin of unification of table markup.
..	Still needs some tweaking but the general framework
..	is in place.
..* styles.css: Removed different table styles.
..	Added two general table styles:
..	 - listing: for tables showing listings like
..		    search results or schedules.
..	 - formular: for tables used in input forms to
..		     layout the input elements.
..	Added some general use styles, like 'bold', 'more',
..	'withmargin', 'nomargin', 'short', 'title', 'dotted'

2007-06-03  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..Added CSS based themeing support. For details please read
..doc/css-themeing.txt and doc/dev-conventions.txt.
..* setup.h, setup.cpp, setup.ecpp: added setup for theme and
..	selection of theme.
..* pages/*.ecpp: added support for themeable images.
..* tntconfig.cpp: cascaded search for images, to support themeing.

2007-06-03  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

..Setup includes now a local net mask specifying the address range
..without necessary login (#321)

2007-06-02  Christian Wieninger <cwieninger at gmx dot de>

..required version of VDR is now >= 1.4.0-2

2007-06-01  Sascha Volkenandt <sascha at akv-soft dot de>

..The detection of featured plugins was uniformed. The display in
..the about box now reads "active: <version>" or "required:
..<version>"

2007-06-01  Dieter Hametner  <dh+vdr at gekrumbel dot de>

..These changes fix bug entry #339
..* css-themeing.txt: describe how to do css themeing.
..* content.ecpp:
..	- check for additional parameter and use it as mime
..	  type.
..	- use compile time variable USRDIR for path to the files
..	  loaded via content.ecpp
..* pageelems.ecpp: link to css/siteprefs.css
..* pages/*.ecpp: changed style link to pageelems.stylesheet
..	        component.
..* tntconfig.cpp: added MapUrl for css<something>/cssfile.

unrecorded  Sascha Volkenandt <sascha at akv-soft dot de>

..Due to the introduction of a uniform header for C++ standard
..extensions, the boost library is now only necessary if the used
..g++ compiler version is less than 4.0
