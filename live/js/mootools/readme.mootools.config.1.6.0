Don't move to 1.6 . Too much effort :(

If you try, you need: core + more


Changes:

====== options  ===============================================
For classes with options: {
var PageEnhance = new Class({
    Implements: [Options],
    options: {

====== pick  ===============================================
var epgid = [href, ""].pick();

====== $defined  ===============================================
var $defined = function(obj){
    return (obj != undefined);
};

// or just use it like this:
if(obj != undefined){
    // do something
}


====== Event ===============================================
event.page[z] : does not work, use event.pageX & event.pageY
event.stop(): not defined, try stopImmediatePropagation()   (guess)


====== Tips ===============================================
this.tips.build: not defined. Use
        this.tips.attach(elems_use);

completely re-write hinttips.js:
this relies on the implementation of the Hints class, which completely changed
Here I gave up: Too much effort, too little benefit ...


====== info-win ===============================================
Also larger changes required ...
