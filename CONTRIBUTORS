Rolf Ahrenberg
 for lots of finish translations and the initial implementation of
 streaming of live tv via streamdev into a browser window using the
 vlc plugin for firefox. And a lot of usefull hints about the features
 of the vlc plugins, some of which still need to be added to LIVE.

Patrice Staudt
  for the french translations.

Matthias Kortstiege
 for a patch that activates the SSL support in tntnet. LIVE can then be
 used over https too. This works only with tntnet versions above 1.6.0.6.
 Recomended is tntnet version 1.6.3 and higher.
